**Enforce classic JavaScript practices in TypeScript codebase by banning excessive keywords**

Though TypeScript has brought us type-saftey for web development, many developers agree on that it has too many duplicated keywords and ways of writing code to achieve the same thing.

Not only that, TypeScript is not a standard web language. If the codebase contains too many TypeScript-specific statements, it might be hard to refactor the code once alternatives arise, such as [the type annoation proposal for JavaScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations).

Based on [`eslint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [`typescript-eslint`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint), this configuration enforces classic JavaScript practices in TypeScript codebase by banning excessive keywords. JavaScript is the original language that has its own way of doing things.
